## 🚀 Brief Idea
Are you looking for a simple and effective way to track your reps at the gym? 💪 Do you want to improve your fitness and performance with real-time feedback and data? 🚀 If yes, then you need to check out Rep Tracker Elite, a project that I created using mediapipe, tkinter, custom tkinter, opencv, sk learn, and pillow. 🤖

Rep Tracker Elite is a smart rep counter that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and count the ups and downs that you do in your workouts. Whether it’s push-ups, squats, lunges, or any other exercise, Rep Tracker Elite can recognize and record your movements with high accuracy and speed. 📈

All you need is a webcam and a laptop, and you’re good to go. Just set up your camera in front of you, choose your exercise, and start your workout. Rep Tracker Elite will automatically count your reps and display them on a user-friendly interface. 🎥 You can also see your progress, calories burned, and time elapsed on the screen. ⏱️

Rep Tracker Elite is not only a rep counter, but also a fitness coach and motivator. It can give you audio and visual feedback, such as encouraging words, tips, and warnings, to help you improve your form and technique. 🎤 It can also challenge you to beat your previous records and reach your goals. 🏆
